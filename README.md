### Aim

Now that some practice with APIs been done and some projects to share, this is to update portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.
Even if opting out of career services, this is *still a required task*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but it's also *critical* on your journey as a developer.
